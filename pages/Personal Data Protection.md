# Personal Data Protection

Sembawang Secondary School is committed to the responsible management of our student’s and visitor’s personal data.

**Regarding Use of Photographs and Videos**

Photograph(s) or video image(s) of you may be captured during school events, programmes, and related activities. We may use and publish such photographs and/or video recordings in school publications, website, social media channels, and other official school communication channels.

CCTVs may be in operation in and around our premises as necessary in the interest of security.

**Regarding the School Website**

The school does not capture data that allows us to identify you individually during browsing.

If you choose to make an application or send us an email for which you provide us with personally identifiable data, no personal data will be shared without your consent or with other entities, except where such entities have been authorised to carry out specific Government services.

To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data are secured with appropriate security technologies.
