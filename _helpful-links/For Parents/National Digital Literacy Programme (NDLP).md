<h3>The National Digital Literacy Programme</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to help students <strong>strengthen their digital literacy and</strong>  <strong>acquire digital skills </strong>needed
to navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will <strong>own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)</strong>.
Students may use funds from their Edusave Account&nbsp;to pay for the PLD.</p>

<h4><strong>PLD Initiative:</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>How does the PLD Initiative impact Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L)?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The PLD Initiative will enhance T&amp;L by:</p>
<p>a) Supporting greater customization and differentiation in learning.</p>
<p>b) Empowering students to engage in self-directed learning anytime and
anywhere.</p>
<p>c) Enhancing the development of 21st Century Competencies and Digital
Literacy.</p>
<p>d) Empowering teachers with deeper data-driven insights into student learning.</p>
<p>The PLD Initiative also supports the pervasive use of the Singapore Student
Learning Space (SLS) in schools which allows students to have seamless
access to online learning in and out of class.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Do all students in a school have to use the same device? What about students who opt out of using the school-selected device and wish to use their own?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a smooth learning experience, students should use a device with the
same Operating System (OS) and similar technical specifications as the
model prescribed by the school. Students who do not wish to purchase the
school-prescribed device and would like to use their own computing devices
must seek approval from the school before they can pursue this option.
The school will ascertain whether the students’ devices run on the same
OS and have similar technical specifications that allows the MOE Device
Management Application (DMA) to be installed.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>What is Device Management Application (DMA)?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your child's Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be installed with a Device
Management Application (DMA) to provide a safer digital environment for
learning. The DMA will be funded by MOE &amp; be uninstalled when your
child graduates or leave school</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Do students/parents buy from the vendor purchasing portals or do schools do the mass purchase for the students?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Schools will facilitate the purchase of the PLD from the MOE Device Bulk
Tender on their students’ behalf.</p>
<p>For students using a compatible student-owned device who wish to purchase
these accessories separately without purchasing the school-prescribed PLD,
schools may advise them to do so via the respective vendor’s purchasing
portal. However, EPF cannot be used for these purchases from the vendor’s
portal.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>**Insurance coverage is for the <strong>main device only</strong> and <strong>does not cover accessories</strong>
</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>What is the expected shelf life of the device? What happens to the device after the student graduates?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The devices have an average shelf life of 3-4 years, which sufficiently
covers the time a student is in secondary school. The school will uninstall
the DMA from the devices upon students’ graduation, and graduated students
will have full control over their devices</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Can students share one device with their siblings?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a smooth learning experience, each student should have his/her own
device as prescribed by the school. This is because different schools may
tap on different devices for Teaching &amp; Learning. In addition, as students
will be required to use the devices in school daily and for their learning
after school, it might not be practical to share the device with their
siblings.</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Can students opt not to purchase the device?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every student is required to have a device for learning purposes. They
are encouraged to purchase one through the school via the MOE Device Bulk
Tender. Students who already own a device running on the same OS and do
not wish to purchase another device will have to seek approval from the
school before they can pursue this option.</p>
