**Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) @ SMB**

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education (NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. In Sembawang Secondary School, our CCE vision is&nbsp;**civic-minded change-makers with a strong moral compass**. This is in alignment to the national CCE goal to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to be good individuals and useful citizens.

The school works towards developing&nbsp;**Leaders and Change-makers**&nbsp;who possess the desired attributes, values, competencies and skills set through the head, heart and hand (3Hs) approach which is progressive and developmental.

**CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame**

CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way. The CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame takes reference from the existing Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes and aims to enhance clarity on how the core values are linked to the social-emotional competencies, and how they are internalised and lived out by our students.

The curriculum content of CCE is based on the&nbsp;**three big ideas of Identity, Relationships, and Choices,**&nbsp;and comprises the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.

The Curriculum Content Areas include

*   **National Education (NE),**
*   **Sexuality Education (SEd),**
*   **Mental Health (MH),**
*   **Education and Career Guidance (ECG),**
*   **Cyber Wellness (CW) and**
*   **Family Education (FE).**

There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, Key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject lessons, and learning opportunities beyond school. For the enactment of CCE to have sustainable impact on our students, a caring and enabling school environment is needed to support their dispositional development.

**Key CCE Programmes:**

*   **Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**
*   **Cyberwellness(CW)**
*   **Vaues in Action (VIA)**
*   **Citizenship Education (CE)**
*   **Environmental Conservation(EC)**

**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

**ECG Key Message:**&nbsp;**To continually develop students’ interests, abilities and passion and teach them to contribute meaningfully to society through their future professions.**

In Sembawang Secondary School, a holistic approach is adopted in planning and implementing our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme. As part of ECG development in our students, the school inspires all students to set goals and strongly encourages all graduating students to apply for tertiary courses via Early Admission Exercise (EAE) and Direct School Admission (DSA).

The distinctive ECG programmes that were organised by the school include Polytechnic Open House Visits, Experience ITE Programme, Early Admission Exercise (EAE) talks (ITE and Polytechnic), Education and Career Guidance Fair, Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Learning Journey to Lifelong Learning Institute, ECG Professional Development talks for teachers by our ECG Counsellor, ECG Counselling and talks for students by our ECG Counsellor.  

ECG lessons are conducted within the CCE curriculum. The focus at the Secondary level is to allow students to develop self-awareness, explore possible career pathways and discover various education options. Students are encouraged to utilise the MySkillsFuture Student Portal for further exploration. These programmes help to enhance students’ knowledge on post- secondary education and provide the platform for them to gain experience and exposure of the various tertiary pathways and career options in various industries.

**Cyber Wellness(CW)**

**Key Message:**&nbsp;**Discerning and responsible digital users who are able to protect themselves and their well-being in the cyberspace.**

The objectives of the various Cyber Wellness programmes are to provide students with enduring social-emotional skills and values and to foster their ability to be safe and responsible digital learners. 

In Sembawang Secondary School, we aim to achieve this by imparting knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes that promote self-respect, respect for others, and responsible use of technology. The goal is for students to exhibit positive peer influence and leverage technology for the betterment of the community.

We achieved these through 4 key programmes as below:

Key Programme 1: Assembly sharing

Assembly sessions are conducted to share current and relevant Cyber Wellness news with the student community to reinforce their learning and keep them updated on digital world affairs.

**Citizenship Education (CE)**

**Key Message****:**&nbsp;**We believe our students and teachers are informed citizens who have a heart for the nation through cultivation of national cohesion, sense of belonging and confidence in the future.**

The distinctive CE programmes that were organised by the school include Total Defence Day celebration, Racial Harmony Day celebration and National Day celebration. Through discussions of contemporary issues, customized class-based CCE lessons, citizenship experiences and celebration of these four annual events, students are guided in exploring and examining their Singapore identity. 

**TOTAL DEFENCE DAY 2023**
		 
For the commemoration of Total Defence Day (TDD), we kickstarted it with a skit during assembly to showcase the importance of the six pillars of TDD. Citizenship Education (CE), Cyberwellness (CW) and uniformed group leaders were also given the opportunities to share more about the six pillars of TDD. During CCE lesson, students highlighted their commitment by designing a scratch card and placing it together as a class to form a meaningful design related to Total Defence.

**INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY 2023**
International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. Students were treated to songs from different countries and its significance during the assembly period.

International students and Citizenship Education (CE) leaders also shared interesting and fascinating information about other countries. During CCE lesson, CE leaders explored the importance of maintaining and exploring relationship with the region and the world. Commemoration of IFD help students to gain a deeper appreciation of regional cooperation and infuse students with a global outlook that makes them open to working well with people of different cultures.

**RACIAL HARMONY DAY 2023**

For the commemoration of Racial Harmony Day, students were engaged in discussions and reflected on what it means to live in a multicultural society like Singapore and how we can work together to strengthen racial and religious harmony. At the end of the day, we learnt that harmony comes not through tolerating the differences but a genuine appreciation of our shared aspirations.

**NATIONAL DAY 2023**

For our Nation’s 58th birthday, we began the day with a record of a parade segment where our Uniform Groups and CE Leaders conducted the flag-raising ceremony with pride. We continued the day celebrating our nation’s achievements and commitment to stay united as one people through the customised CCE lesson in class. We ended the day with the hall segment where the school is treated to performances by our very own performing arts CCA groups. By providing meaningful learning experiences, we hope to inculcate a sense of rootedness and belonging to the school and Singapore.
