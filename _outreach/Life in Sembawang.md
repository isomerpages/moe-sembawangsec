### Budding Scientists @ SMB

“Sembawang Secondary School participated in the 20th International Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition (2019) organized by Anderson Serangoon Junior College. Elementz is a prestigious annual competition that accords recognition to students who have conducted exemplary scientific research.

This year, one team – comprising of five Secondary 4 students – was put forward to present their scientific findings and exchange views with other young scientists from Singapore and overseas during the conference. Heng Yu Jie, Looh Shi Xiang Skyler, Shiu Julius Billian, R Karthik and Wai Qi Min spent two months refining and executing their research project.

The project entitled “Upside-down gardening: A complementary method to enhance Singapore’s urban gardens” aimed to maximize the limited space in Singapore’s burgeoning urban gardens, allowing everyday Singaporeans to produce their own organic fruits, vegetables and herbs right in their own homes. The project objectives were to ascertain how this form of gardening affects the yield and productivity of common garden plants. Through this project, a model for a home-grown upside-down garden was established and made available for replication to expand the green areas in Singapore.

The team was conferred the Bronze Award by the Guest of Honour, Mr Tan Bee Teck (MOE’s Director of IT, and GovTech’s Cluster Director for Education) at the conclusion of the Elementz Conference. This is a testament to the students’ dedication to sound scientific experimentation and commitment to excellence. The students would like to extend their gratitude to Mrs Johanna Santarossa (teacher mentor), Mr Ernest Yu, Mr Wong Jie, Mr Singh, Mr Lee and Mr Goh for their unwavering support and guidance throughout the Conference.

### SMB celebrates Total Defence Day

The Total Defence theme for 2019 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”, which focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives. For Sembawang Secondary this year, we invited Lieutenant Colonel Richard Koh, Commandant NCC, to share about his various experiences while working as a regular in the military, as well as how these are related to the five pillars of Total Defence.

LTC Koh’s sharing was engaging for the students, where they learnt about resilience and responsibility through the sharing of his interesting anecdotes. Not only that, they were also able to see the importance and relevance of Total Defence in their everyday life, and why it is important to practice and commemorate Total Defence – As no one owes Singapore a living, and it is our duty and responsibility to protect the country.

The students were also introduced to the sixth pillar of Defence – Digital Defence, where they learnt that cyber-security threats and disinformation are a serious danger to Singapore, and why the citizens of Singapore need to be vigilant against them. All in all, the commemoration of Total Defence was a meaningful affair at Sembawang Secondary and the students were able to understand that Total Defence is not just a yearly affair, but also an everyday responsibility.

### SMB@Maker Faire Singapore 2018  
_August 2018_

At the recent public event, held between 17 and 19 August, we showcased creations by our students at an exhibit under the Infocom Media Development Authority (IMDA). A total of 10 schools were selected to feature their Digital Maker projects after attending a workshop to code a Micro:bit using a simple programming software and apply their coding knowledge to make scientifically-sound and technologically-enhanced products. Our students had the opportunity to interact with members of the public and explain how their projects would be used to help the larger community. One of the two projects aim to help children overcome their fear of the dark while the other was created with the intention to help the elderly see better in the dark.

### We Are Singapore!  
August 2018

National Day Celebrations 2018 started off with an observance ceremony by selected uniformed group members. The Hall was a sea of red and white as both staff and students of the school came dressed in our national colours. What followed were some games and a singalong session of our favourite National Day songs.  Here are some well-wishes from our students for Singapore!

_“Happy Birthday Singapore!  I hope we will continue to prosper and grow together!  Without Singapore, all of us would not be where we are today.”_  
_Brenda Muk, 4TE1_

_Happy Birthday Singapore!  We hope that Singapore will continue to strive for the better and our country will continue to celebrate our diversity for years to come._

### Sound of Unity

Unity in Diversity, Vibrancy in Colours and Community Harmony! All these paint the picture of our community. As part of our CCE curriculum, our Values-In-Action (VIA) project helps to create an awareness of community issues and also encourages action and advocacy. To increase the sense of belonging within the Sembawang Community, our secondary 2 students embarked on a Mural Painting VIA project this year.

The idea was conceived in 2017 when selected secondary 2 students presented their Applied Learning Programme (ALP) project at the Canberra Day event. Their idea was to foster a sense of community belonging and harmony within Sembawang Community by putting up Mural Paintings depicting art works that combine different ethnic instruments around the HDB blocks in Sembawang estate. During the presentation, the project idea was well-received by the residents and MP for Sembawang GRC (Canberra), Dr Lim Wee Kiak. Thus, in 2018, the school decided to implement the project which involved all the students from the secondary 2 classes as part of their VIA project. The duration of the project lasted one semester, from January to May 2018, and their completed works had just been put up recently. The integration of Citizenship Education (CE) through this VIA project had a great impact on our students. Our students found the project to be meaningful and have created a positive impact on the community.

**Students’ Thoughts on the Project…**

**ARNAVI D/O TAMILSELVEN (2CO5)** – I have learnt the values of Respect and Responsibility. This project is a group effort. I have learnt that we need to respect our team-mates’ opinion and also do our own part in the project. Through the mural painting project, I have learnt about instruments that symbolise the different races. Combining them together allows one to think about living harmoniously.

**NUR AQIILAH BINTE SALAHUDIN (2CO4)** – I used my creativity to do the art work, which allows my brain to think constantly. When we received feedback about the art work, I learnt to be resilient by being receptive to the feedback, being positive and making amendments to enhance it. I was able to think out of the box and persevere in completing the art piece to benefit the Sembawang Community.

### Helping Hands

HOD PE/CCA Mr Janarthanam was busy training our school boys for an upcoming Track and Field Championship at Woodlands stadium when he noticed a man who had suddenly collapsed to the ground clutching desperately onto the blades of grass where he had fallen. Just a few moments before that, the man had walked past Mr Janar and his students!

Sensing that the man needed help, Mr Janar and the boys strode quickly to render help. Several other concerned public members also gathered around the man.

HOD quickly ordered 2 of his students to inform stadium stewards the incident and to bring along an AED device. HOD also informed one of the boys to call for an ambulance. Other members of the public who were there also tried to render aid to the stricken man. As there was no response from the man and no visible sign of breathing, HOD then applied chest compressions. Others also helped to revive the man.

After some time, stadium stewards and experienced lifeguards from the nearby Woodlands swimming pool arrived and proceeded to administer the AED while still trying to give compressions. A total of two shocks were given before the emergency services arrived and took over.![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Helping-Hands-300x200.jpg)

Mr Janar added, “As for our school boys, I’m proud that they responded in such an emergency showing care and concern and displaying civic mindedness.”

A month after the incident, Mr Janar received a phone call from officers of the Woodlands stadium to convey the message that the man was put in intensive care unit for three days before regaining consciousness. He wanted very much to thank the boys and those who attended to him and managed to do so at a national ceremony on 4 Feb 2018 at the OCBC Arena Sports Hub where Mr Janar and his students received Certificates of Commendation as part of Survivor Awards 2018. Mr Janar and his students also received a congratulatory note from Minister for Education, Mr Ng Chee Meng.

CPR is taught to all Sec 1 and Sec 2 students in Term 3 during the Outdoor Education lesson as part of the PE syllabus.

Kudos to Sembawang!

### Lights, Camera, Geography!

“Sembawang is special. How can we make it even better?” asks Mdm Masriani of her Secondary 2 Geography students. Thus commences her students’ journey into creative problem-solving for the current batch of Sec 2 students as part of their Applied Learning Programme in Geography.

As part of introducing students to geographical investigations in Housing, students in Sembawang Secondary School are challenged each year to identify ways to improve the community in Sembawang.

Working in groups of 4, students interview residents and collate data to gather information on the needs of residents in the school’s neighbourhood. Back in the school, students then propose creative solutions to improve the community. The twist? Students are only allowed to present their information in a self-made 3-minute video production. Wondering why? At Sembawang, we combine Geography with Media Literacy — so that our students not only find solutions but know how to present them!

![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Geo2-267x300.jpg)

The solutions proposed by students include improvements to the transport facilities, building a hawker centre for residents, and encouraging the return of trays at food courts. As for Cinta and her group, they zoomed in on improving the social etiquette in food courts and hawker centres.

Ninuri Ruwansi, a Sec 2 student, shared her experience. ‘We interviewed residents to find out how to further develop the facilities in Sembawang and most mentioned that the cleanliness of the food court could be further improved. Through our observation, we realized that this could be because customers at food courts usually do not return their trays. In order to raise the awareness of the consequences of not returning the trays, we prepared stickers for the food tables as a reminder to the patrons of the food courts.”

“At first I found the task challenging. We were hesitant to ask the residents our interview questions as we were not sure if they would be able to understand our questions that is mostly based on Geography concepts. We learnt to adapt and break it down into many simpler questions.” says Cinta Hannah Binte Hairulzahri, a group leader.

![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Geo1-300x199.jpg)

“It was also difficult to get residents to be featured in our video. Most of them were shy and walked away from us upon knowing our request. However, we persevered and were able to get more than the required number of respondents needed.” added Ninuri.

“These learning experiences are all part of developing our students to be change-makers and to impact the community positively. In addition, this project builds confidence and opens students up to the possibilities afforded by digital tools,” says Ms Munirah, the project coordinator and Geography Subject Head.

Ms Munirah adds, “Students are inherently creative and we are merely unleashing this creativity for the greater good.”

### Boats Ahoy!

In 2016, Sembawang Secondary School opted to introduce Dragon Boating into our outdoor education enrichment programme for Sec 2 students. What appealed to us was the inherent teamwork and resilience which can be developed through the sport. In addition, dragon boating blended suitably with our Learning for Life programme.

![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dragon-Boat-300x206.jpg)

We believe that teamwork, caring for one another, and resilience are traits that are vital for our students so that they can become confident and concerned citizens of the future. Our aim was also to expose students to outdoor experiential learning so that they will be engaged in lifelong physical fitness pursuits when they graduate from school and into life. As part of the programme, our students learnt the necessary skills, knowledge, and risk management planning required for such a sport.

The introduction of dragon boating has been well received by student and teachers alike. It allows students to be bold, to pursue adventure, and to persevere,” says Mr S. Janarthanam, HOD PE & CCA.

### SMB Youth Games

### 29 June 2018

The much awaited SMB Youth Games was held at the Woodlands Stadium this year. The students and staff entered into the spirit of the occasion by donning the House Attire. The event started off at 7.30am with Morning Assembly followed by the Opening Ceremony. The first event was the Mass Run. It was lovely to see many our students determined to complete the Mass Run in the fastest possible time. Once the 100m races began, the air was filled with the cheering for the athletes.

However, it started to rain at about 9am and everyone took shelter at the grandstand after the lightning alert. While waiting for the rain to subside and the lightning alert to go away, students and teachers practised their House cheering. The wet weather continued but the SMB spirit was not dampened. Blue Marlins was leading the SMB Youth Games when we ended the event. Despite the rain, we all had fun running the Mass Run, cheering for the athletes and enjoying the refreshment that was provided.  Well done to all who took part!

Students’ Reflections
---------------------

中医

_3E 伟伦_

这次的中医活动让我们认识了更多关于中医的知识。中医师解除了几个我们对中医的误解，像是学会中医就可以为别人“点穴”等。除此之外，她还告诉了我们一些中医的小贴士，像是头疼应该按哪个部位可以改善。这次的活动让我们更加认识中医，而不是一说到医术就只想到西医。

相声

_3E伟伦_

我觉得这是一个富有意义的活动，因为这次的活动让我校学生有一个机会可以接触到这门深奥的艺术。主讲老师—小孟老师生动地告诉我们现今的相声是什么样的，我也知道了相声不只是老人会接触的领域，现在很多年轻人也对相声产生浓厚的兴趣。小孟老师告诉我们相声的基本知识，以及几种不同类型的相声，让我受益良多。

茶艺

_2NT洁怡_

我在这个活动上学到了泡茶的文化和习俗，除了这些，我还学到了如何泡茶。我觉得活动很有意思，让我更了解华族的文化。

Secondary 2 and 3 Drama Workshop (Tamil)

“I was very glad to meet Mr. Ananda Kannan who conducted the drama workshop after doing a module with him previously. Since, I am new to this school I got to bond with my schoolmates here. In this drama workshop, I have learnt how to use different types of expressions in different situations. I also learnt how to create a story. I got to realise my friends’ hidden talents. I think that it was a good platform to showcase our acting skills. That was definitely a fun and engaging experience for me.”

Secondary 1 Mother Tongue Camp (Tamil) 

“We went to ‘Fort Canning’ for our MTFN Sec 1 camp. It was a very new place to me and I have never hear of this place. It was a very fun trip. I met many new friends. At first we went to spice garden. I have learnt about different types of spices and their uses. Then I did henna template and it was fun to do as it was my first time doing henna. I learnt how to draw henna design. Also we learnt how to draw ‘Kolam’. I was so excited when I drew kolam first time in my life. Finally I learnt some dance movements. It was a wonderful experience”
