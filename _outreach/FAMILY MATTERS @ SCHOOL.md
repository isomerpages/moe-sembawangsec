### Background

School Family Education (SFE) is one of the recommendations of Family Matters! Singapore \[previously known as Public Education Committee on Family (PEC)\].

SFE adopts a holistic family learning model – equipping parents with effective parenting skills and training them to be parent facilitators, helping school staff to enhance their family life, and providing students with life skills training.

The parent-child relationship has much impact on the child’s academic achievements and positive attitudes/ behaviour, regardless of socio-economic status, ethnic/ racial background or parents’ education level.
