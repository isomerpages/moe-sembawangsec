<p>The Malay Dance troupe provides rich opportunities for students to develop
their talent and passion for dance. As the activities in Malay Dance promote
teamwork, students are able to develop their leadership skills, relationship
skills and social awareness. Studentsâ€™ confidence is also being built as
they express themselves through dance and stage various performances.</p>
<p>The dance club has achieved numerous accolades since its establishment.
They have received Gold/Gold with Honours/Certificate of Distinction in
the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation from 2003 to 2023.

and Ngee Ann City and performed overseas in Bandung, (Indonesia), Kuala
Lumpur (Malaysia) and Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam).</p>
