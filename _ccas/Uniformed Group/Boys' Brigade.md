<p>Sembawang Secondary School’s Boys’ Brigade Company was founded in 1984
as the 13th Singapore Company (BB) in Yio Chu Kang Secondary before it
shifted over in 2000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many opportunities for our boys to grow physically and socially.
Through a wide range of activities, the boys acquire many important life
skills. They learn to communicate effectively and organise events, displaying
servant leadership in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, the 13<sup>th</sup> Company has been consistently performing well.
With respect to awards, the Company has attained the JM Fraser Award for
Excellence (Distinction) for several consecutive years, as well as produced
several Founders’ Men. The Founder's Award is the highest and most prestigious
award in the Seniors Programme. To win the award, cadets need to participate
in all approved Brigade's level activities, conceptualise a community project
and develop their portfolio of achievements over the past four years of
their secondary school journey.</p>
