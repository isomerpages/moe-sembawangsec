CCA Selection

In Sembawang all Sec 1 students are given a period a month to visit the different CCAs in the school to get an experience and understand the CCA better. In all about 95% of students in Sec 1 will get their first 3 choices of CCA.

CCA Achievement

This year more than 75% or two-third of our graduating students have attained an Excellent in their CCA grade. A testament to the students’ commitment, participation and leadership in their different chosen CCA.

_Chinese Dance_

Chinese Dance as a CCA was established in 2018. In their maiden SYF Arts Presentation in 2019 they achieved a Silver. It is a very commendable achievement for such a young CCA. We are excited to see how far students can excel in their CCA and showcase their talent.
