<p>The MediaComm Club is a CCA which plays an essential role in recording
the school’s events and activities via videography.&nbsp; The club also
aims to develop the videographic skills of the members by providing opportunities
to gain exposure through competitions with other schools.</p>
<p>Besides receiving training in videography, members are always taught to
be mindful of having empathy while creating their videos so that they can
tell the audience a story to make a difference in society.&nbsp; Leaders
are also actively developed in the CCA to cultivate the members to lead
in the future when they become experts in their respective fields.</p>
