<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p><u>INVITATION TO JOIN PARENTS SUPPORT GROUP (PSG) </u>
</p>
<p>The school is setting up a Parents Support Group (PSG) for the parents
of the students from Sembawang Secondary School. The function of the PSG
is to organise workshops and activities to strengthen bonds and foster
better relationships between the parents, students and the school.</p>
<p>As parents, you play an essential role in guiding and supporting your
child through the ups and downs of their adolescence. With the right tools
and insights, you can empower them to thrive during this important phase
of life through our engaging and informative parenting talks which are
specially designed to provide parents with valuable strategies and a supportive
space to deepen connections with your child. We hope that through this
workshop, you will discover practical and meaningful ways to strengthen
family bonds, foster emotional nurturance and share engaging conversations
with your child.</p>
<p>We sincerely invite you to join our School Parents Support Group. Kindly
register your interest through the QR code provided below or through the
school website. More details will be shared with you in due time.</p>
<p>We look forward to your participation. Thank you.</p>
