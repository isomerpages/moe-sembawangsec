<p>This will allow the child to stretch himself/herself and acquire deeper
competencies in his/her area(s) of strengths, fostering greater ownership
over his/her learning and nurturing a growth mindset.</p>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students who do well in school-based
assessments may offer subjects at a more demanding level if found suitable
to do so by their schools.</p>
