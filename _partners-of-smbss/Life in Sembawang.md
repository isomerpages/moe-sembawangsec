<h3>Budding Scientists @ SMB</h3>
<p>“Sembawang Secondary School participated in the 20th&nbsp;International
Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition (2019) organized by
Anderson Serangoon Junior College. Elementz is a prestigious annual competition
that accords recognition to students who have conducted exemplary scientific
research.</p>
<p>This year, one team – comprising of five Secondary 4 students – was put
forward to present their scientific findings and exchange views with other
young scientists from Singapore and overseas during the conference. Heng
Yu Jie, Looh Shi Xiang Skyler, Shiu Julius Billian, R Karthik and Wai Qi
Min spent two months refining and executing their research project.</p>
<p>The project entitled “Upside-down gardening: A complementary method to
enhance Singapore’s urban gardens” aimed to maximize the limited space
in Singapore’s burgeoning urban gardens, allowing everyday Singaporeans
to produce their own organic fruits, vegetables and herbs right in their
own homes. The project objectives were to ascertain how this form of gardening
affects the yield and productivity of common garden plants. Through this
project, a model for a home-grown upside-down garden was established and
made available for replication to expand the green areas in Singapore.</p>
<p>The team was conferred the Bronze Award by the Guest of Honour, Mr Tan
Bee Teck (MOE’s Director of IT, and GovTech’s Cluster Director for Education)
at the conclusion of the Elementz Conference. This is a testament to the
students’ dedication to sound scientific experimentation and commitment
to excellence. The students would like to extend their gratitude to Mrs
Johanna Santarossa (teacher mentor), Mr Ernest Yu, Mr Wong Jie, Mr Singh,
Mr Lee and Mr Goh for their unwavering support and guidance throughout
the Conference.</p>

<h3>SMB celebrates Total Defence Day</h3>
<p>The Total Defence theme for 2019 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”,
which focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in
our everyday lives. For Sembawang Secondary this year, we invited Lieutenant
Colonel Richard Koh, Commandant NCC, to share about his various experiences
while working as a regular in the military, as well as how these are related
to the five pillars of Total Defence.</p>
<p>LTC Koh’s sharing was engaging for the students, where they learnt about
resilience and responsibility through the sharing of his interesting anecdotes.
Not only that, they were also able to see the importance and relevance
of Total Defence in their everyday life, and why it is important to practice
and commemorate Total Defence – As no one owes Singapore a living, and
it is our duty and responsibility to protect the country.</p>
<p>The students were also introduced to the sixth pillar of Defence – Digital
Defence, where they learnt that cyber-security threats and disinformation
are a serious danger to Singapore, and why the citizens of Singapore need
to be vigilant against them. All in all, the commemoration of Total Defence
was a meaningful affair at Sembawang Secondary and the students were able
to understand that Total Defence is not just a yearly affair, but also
an everyday responsibility.</p>

<h3>SMB@Maker Faire Singapore 2018</h3>
<p><em>August 2018</em>
</p>
<p>At the recent public event, held between 17 and 19 August, we showcased
creations by our students at an exhibit under the Infocom Media Development
Authority (IMDA). A total of 10 schools were selected to feature their
Digital Maker projects after attending a workshop to code a Micro:bit using
a simple programming software and apply their coding knowledge to make
scientifically-sound and technologically-enhanced products. Our students
had the opportunity to interact with members of the public and explain
how their projects would be used to help the larger community. One of the
two projects aim to help children overcome their fear of the dark while
the other was created with the intention to help the elderly see better
in the dark.</p>

<h3>We Are Singapore!</h3>
<p>August 2018</p>
<p>National Day Celebrations 2018 started off with an observance ceremony
by selected uniformed group members. The Hall was a sea of red and white
as both staff and students of the school came dressed in our national colours.
What followed were some games and a singalong session of our favourite
National Day songs.&nbsp; Here are some well-wishes from our students for
Singapore!</p>
<p><em>“Happy Birthday Singapore!&nbsp; I hope we will continue to prosper and grow together!&nbsp; Without Singapore, all of us would not be where we are today.”</em>
<br><em>Brenda Muk, 4TE1</em>
</p>
<p><em>Happy Birthday Singapore!&nbsp; We hope that Singapore will continue to strive for the better and our country will continue to celebrate our diversity for years to come.</em>

<h3>Sound of Unity</h3>
<p>Unity in Diversity, Vibrancy in Colours and Community Harmony! All these
paint the picture of our community. As part of our CCE curriculum, our
Values-In-Action (VIA) project helps to create an awareness of community
issues and also encourages action and advocacy. To increase the sense of
belonging within the Sembawang Community, our secondary 2 students embarked
on a Mural Painting VIA project this year.</p>
<p>The idea was conceived in 2017 when selected secondary 2 students presented
their Applied Learning Programme (ALP) project at the Canberra Day event.
Their idea was to foster a sense of community belonging and harmony within
Sembawang Community by putting up Mural Paintings depicting art works that
combine different ethnic instruments around the HDB blocks in Sembawang
estate. During the presentation, the project idea was well-received by
the residents and MP for Sembawang GRC (Canberra), Dr Lim Wee Kiak. Thus,
in 2018, the school decided to implement the project which involved all
the students from the secondary 2 classes as part of their VIA project.
The duration of the project lasted one semester, from January to May 2018,
and their completed works had just been put up recently. The integration
of Citizenship Education (CE) through this VIA project had a great impact
on our students. Our students found the project to be meaningful and have
created a positive impact on the community.</p>

<p><strong>Students’ Thoughts on the Project…</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ARNAVI D/O TAMILSELVEN (2CO5)</strong>&nbsp;– I have learnt the
values of Respect and Responsibility. This project is a group effort. I
have learnt that we need to respect our team-mates’ opinion and also do
our own part in the project. Through the mural painting project, I have
learnt about instruments that symbolise the different races. Combining
them together allows one to think about living harmoniously.</p>
<p><strong>NUR AQIILAH BINTE SALAHUDIN (2CO4)</strong>&nbsp;– I used my creativity
to do the art work, which allows my brain to think constantly. When we
received feedback about the art work, I learnt to be resilient by being
receptive to the feedback, being positive and making amendments to enhance
it. I was able to think out of the box and persevere in completing the
art piece to benefit the Sembawang Community.</p>

<h3>Helping Hands</h3>
<p>HOD PE/CCA Mr Janarthanam was busy training our school boys for an upcoming
Track and Field Championship at Woodlands stadium when he noticed a man
who had suddenly collapsed to the ground clutching desperately onto the
blades of grass where he had fallen. Just a few moments before that, the
man had walked past Mr Janar and his students!</p>
<p>Sensing that the man needed help, Mr Janar and the boys strode quickly
to render help. Several other concerned public members also gathered around
the man.</p>
<p>HOD quickly ordered 2 of his students to inform stadium stewards the incident
and to bring along an AED device. HOD also informed one of the boys to
call for an ambulance. Other members of the public who were there also
tried to render aid to the stricken man. As there was no response from
the man and no visible sign of breathing, HOD then applied chest compressions.
Others also helped to revive the man.</p>
<p>After some time, stadium stewards and experienced lifeguards from the
nearby Woodlands swimming pool arrived and proceeded to administer the
AED while still trying to give compressions. A total of two shocks were
given before the emergency services arrived and took over.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Helping-Hands-768x512.jpeg">
</div>
<p>Mr Janar added, “As for our school boys, I’m proud that they responded
in such an emergency showing care and concern and displaying civic mindedness.”</p>
<p>A month after the incident, Mr Janar received a phone call from officers
of the Woodlands stadium to convey the message that the man was put in
intensive care unit for three days before regaining consciousness. He wanted
very much to thank the boys and those who attended to him and managed to
do so at a national ceremony on 4 Feb 2018 at the OCBC Arena Sports Hub
where Mr Janar and his students received Certificates of Commendation as
part of Survivor Awards 2018. Mr Janar and his students also received a
congratulatory note from Minister for Education, Mr Ng Chee Meng.</p>
<p>CPR is taught to all Sec 1 and Sec 2 students in Term 3 during the Outdoor
Education lesson as part of the PE syllabus.</p>

<h3>Lights, Camera, Geography!</h3>
<p>“Sembawang is special. How can we make it even better?” asks Mdm Masriani
of her Secondary 2 Geography students. Thus commences her students’ journey
into creative problem-solving for the current batch of Sec 2 students as
part of their Applied Learning Programme in Geography.</p>
<p>As part of introducing students to geographical investigations in Housing,
students in Sembawang Secondary School are challenged each year to identify
ways to improve the community in Sembawang.</p>
<p>Working in groups of 4, students interview residents and collate data
to gather information on the needs of residents in the school’s neighbourhood.
Back in the school, students then propose creative solutions to improve
the community. The twist? Students are only allowed to present their information
in a self-made 3-minute video production. Wondering why? At Sembawang,
we combine Geography with Media Literacy — so that our students not only
find solutions but know how to present them!</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Geo2.jpeg">
</div>
<p>The solutions proposed by students include improvements to the transport
facilities, building a hawker centre for residents, and encouraging the
return of trays at food courts. As for Cinta and her group, they zoomed
in on improving the social etiquette in food courts and hawker centres.</p>
<p>Ninuri Ruwansi, a Sec 2 student, shared her experience. ‘We interviewed
residents to find out how to further develop the facilities in Sembawang
and most mentioned that the cleanliness of the food court could be further
improved. Through our observation, we realized that this could be because
customers at food courts usually do not return their trays. In order to
raise the awareness of the consequences of not returning the trays, we
prepared stickers for the food tables as a reminder to the patrons of the
food courts.”</p>
<p>“At first I found the task challenging. We were hesitant to ask the residents
our interview questions as we were not sure if they would be able to understand
our questions that is mostly based on Geography concepts. We learnt to
adapt and break it down into many simpler questions.” says Cinta Hannah
Binte Hairulzahri, a group leader.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Geo1-768x511.jpeg">
</div>
<p>“It was also difficult to get residents to be featured in our video. Most
of them were shy and walked away from us upon knowing our request. However,
we persevered and were able to get more than the required number of respondents
needed.” added Ninuri.</p>
<p>“These learning experiences are all part of developing our students to
be change-makers and to impact the community positively. In addition, this
project builds confidence and opens students up to the possibilities afforded
by digital tools,” says Ms Munirah, the project coordinator and Geography
Subject Head.</p>
<p>Ms Munirah adds, “Students are inherently creative and we are merely unleashing
this creativity for the greater good.”</p>

<h3>Boats Ahoy!</h3>
<p>In 2016, Sembawang Secondary School opted to introduce Dragon Boating
into our outdoor education enrichment programme for Sec 2 students. What
appealed to us was the inherent teamwork and resilience which can be developed
through the sport. In addition, dragon boating blended suitably with our
Learning for Life programme.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Dragon-Boat-768x528.jpeg">
</div>
<p>We believe that teamwork, caring for one another, and resilience are traits
that are vital for our students so that they can become confident and concerned
citizens of the future. Our aim was&nbsp;also to expose students to outdoor
experiential learning so that they will be engaged in lifelong physical
fitness pursuits when they graduate from school and into life. As part
of the programme, our students learnt the necessary skills, knowledge,
and risk management planning required for such a sport.</p>
<p>The introduction of dragon boating has been well received by student and
teachers alike. It allows students to be bold, to pursue adventure, and
to persevere,” says Mr S. Janarthanam, HOD PE &amp; CCA.</p>

<h3>SMB Youth Games</h3>
<h3>29 June 2018</h3>
<p>The much awaited SMB Youth Games was held at the Woodlands Stadium this
year. The students and staff entered into the spirit of the occasion by
donning the House Attire. The event started off at&nbsp;7.30am with Morning
Assembly followed by the Opening Ceremony. The first event was the Mass
Run. It was lovely to see many our students determined to complete the
Mass Run in the fastest possible time. Once the 100m races began, the air
was filled with the cheering for the athletes.</p>
<p>However, it started to rain at about 9am and everyone took shelter at
the grandstand after the lightning alert. While waiting for the rain to
subside and the lightning alert to go away, students and teachers practised
their House cheering. The wet weather continued but the SMB spirit was
not dampened. Blue Marlins was leading the SMB Youth Games when we ended
the event. Despite the rain, we all had fun running the Mass Run, cheering
for the athletes and enjoying the refreshment that was provided.&nbsp;
Well done to all who took part!</p>

<p>这次的中医活动让我们认识了更多关于中医的知识。中医师解除了几个我们对中医的误解，像是学会中医就可以为别人“点穴”等。除此之外，她还告诉了我们一些中医的小贴士，像是头疼应该按哪个部位可以改善。这次的活动让我们更加认识中医，而不是一说到医术就只想到西医。</p>

<p>“I was very glad to meet Mr. Ananda Kannan who conducted the drama workshop
after doing a module with him previously. Since, I am new to this school
I got to bond with my schoolmates here. In this drama workshop, I have
learnt how to use different types of expressions in different situations.
I also learnt how to create a story. I got to realise my friends’ hidden

That was definitely a fun and engaging experience for me.”</p>
