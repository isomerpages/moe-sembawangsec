<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p><p>The Mathematics department consists of 3 units – Mathematics, Principles of Accounts (POA) and Computer Applications (CPA).Our Mathematics curriculum aims to equip our pupils with Mathematical skills, processes and concepts so that they will become effective and creative problem solvers in life.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MA1.png"></div><p></p><p>Our department programmes strive to equip our pupils with mathematical skills, processes and concepts to solve problems in a variety of contexts within and outside Mathematics. Our teachers conscientiously practice the 3 phases of learning in the classroom – Readiness to Learn, Engagement in Learning and Mastery in Learning.</p><p><strong>Learning Opportunities for Students</strong></p><p><strong>Mathematics</strong></p><p>We provide opportunities for students to</p><ul><li><p>enhance conceptual understanding through use of various mathematical tools including ICT tools;</p></li><li><p>apply concepts and skills learnt in real-world context;</p></li><li><p>communicate their reasoning and connections through various mathematical tasks and activities;</p></li><li><p>build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Principles of Accounts (POA)</strong></p><p>POA is designed to teach age-appropriate and relevant accounting knowledge, skills and values. In addition, students will understand how businesses use accounting and non-accounting information to make decisions. Through the subject, they will acquire transferrable skills that they can apply in their daily lives. The POA syllabus aims to develop in students the knowledge and skills to prepare, communicate and use both accounting information and non-accounting information related to the business to make decisions. The POA unit includes a series of activities to stimulate students' interest and inquisitiveness towards the subject.</p><p><strong>Computer Applications (CPA)</strong></p><p>The Computer Applications (CPA) syllabus aims to prepare students to be technologically adept citizens, and to function and contribute effectively in an increasingly technologically-driven world. The syllabus emphasizes on fundamental knowledge and skills, and includes the appreciation and use of several software application packages for word processing, computer drawing and image editing, multimedia presentations and documents, spreadsheet calculations and charts, game design, programming; as well as, applications on the Internet. This will better prepare students for further studies in programming and media-related courses; as well as for the workplace and future learning.</p><p>All students will be exposed to internet technologies and tools. Experiential learning continues to be the main feature of this skill-based subject. Tasks that require an integrated use of office software applications and problem sets that guide the learner through the learning process will feature prominently in the course of learning.<br></p><p></p>
