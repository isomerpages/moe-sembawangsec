**PDLP - Programme to Empower Active and Responsible Learning (PEARL)**

![pearl-image](/images/it2.jpeg)

In alignment with the outcome goal of the MOE MasterPlan for ICT in Education – Quality learning in the hands of every learner empowered with technology, PEARL is the school’s very own 1-1 computing access initiative launched since 2017. PEARL aims to promote Active Learning in class through the use of ICT so that our students become better thinkers and more reflective learners.

Teachers, as designers of active learning experiences, are empowered to create an ICT-enriched classroom that is thinking, collaborative and connected. Hence, students would have opportunities to harness the use of technology for collaboration, brainstorming of ideas (making their thinking visible), co-construction of knowledge and even authentic problem-solving in the learning process.

In 2021, PEARL to include MOE’s Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) supporting students on ownership of 1:1 computing devices for learning.&nbsp;

Through PDLP, we aspire to develop our learners as leaders and change-makers:

(i) active, self-directed and collaborative learners who will deepen their disciplinary thinking/skills through active and blended learning experiences, develop their 21CC as well as manage their own learning;

(ii) responsible and competent digital learners who will develop their repertoire of digital literacies for application in their learning process, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.
