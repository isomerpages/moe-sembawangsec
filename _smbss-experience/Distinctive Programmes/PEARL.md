<p>In alignment with the outcome goal of the MOE MasterPlan for ICT in Education
– Quality learning in the hands of every learner empowered with technology,
PEARL is the school’s very own 1-1 computing access initiative launched
since 2017. PEARL aims to promote Active Learning in class through the
use of ICT so that our students become better thinkers and more reflective
learners.</p>

<p>Teachers, as designers of active learning experiences, are empowered to
create an ICT-enriched classroom that is thinking, collaborative and connected.
Hence, students would have opportunities to harness the use of technology
for collaboration, brainstorming of ideas (making their thinking visible),
co-construction of knowledge and even authentic problem-solving in the
learning process.</p>
<p>In 2021, PEARL to include MOE’s Personalised Digital Learning Programme

disciplinary thinking/skills through active and blended learning experiences,
develop their 21CC as well as manage their own learning;</p>

repertoire of digital literacies for application in their learning process,
maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible
users of ICT.</p>
