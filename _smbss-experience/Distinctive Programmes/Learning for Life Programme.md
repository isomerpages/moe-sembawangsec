<h2>Learning for Life Programme</h2>
<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is&nbsp;<strong>Developing Community and Youth Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>Our LLP rides on the strong foundation of our school’s 3 main programmes
– Student Leadership, Values-in-Action (VIA) and Outdoor Education (OE)
and encapsulated in our Vision&nbsp;<strong>Leaders and Change-makers</strong>.
This LLP programme aims to develop Community and Youth Leaders who are
innovative in problem solving, confident and effective communicators and&nbsp;
will&nbsp; be able to lead and serve to bring about improvement to the
lives of others around them.</p>

<p>A 2-tiered approach is applied to provide different depths of experience.
In Tier 1, the activities are organised for the whole school population.
In Tier 2, activities are organised for the high progressing student leaders.
These students will be expected to demonstrate an additional level of competency
and service. In our student leadership framework, the 6 groups of student
leaders are namely:&nbsp;<em>Student Councillors, Class Leaders, CCA Leaders, Cyberwellness Leaders, Environmental Leaders and Citizenship Education Leaders.</em>

<p><strong>SMB Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>VIA programme aims to promote active citizenry among our youth and bring
about a greater sense of engagement and ownership. Teachers facilitate
students’ discussion of community issues and ideas for making a difference.
Curriculum time will be set aside for students to reflect on what they
have learnt at various stages of their projects. In that way, students
continue to apply what they have learnt, and be active contributors and
concerned citizens. Students are encouraged to initiate VIA activities
based on their assessment of the needs of their community.</p>
<p>The VIA Programme will have age-appropriate activities that develop the
relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes to put values into action. The&nbsp;<em>Complexity of Community Problem</em>&nbsp;differs
for the different levels (Sec 1 to Sec 5).</p>
