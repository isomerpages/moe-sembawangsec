<p><strong>About Us</strong><br>Our department believes that all students can learn their Mother Tongue well and develop good oral and written expression skills . The department adopts a student-centred approach, employing various teaching methods. For instance, in the realm of information and communication technology, students utilize the SLS interactive learning platform, fostering an expansive teaching environment that encourages self-study and collaborative learning. These diverse teaching methods aim to spark students’ interest in learning their mother tongue, ultimately cultivating learners who can proficiently use their mother tongue in daily life and communicate effectively with others. Furthermore, teachers employ differentiated teaching methods and seek out a multitude of learning opportunities, so as to support students at varying readiness of learning, allowing all students to maximise their potential. Critical thinking is also incorporated to refine students’ writing skills, enabling them to grasp key points and excel in questioning and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learning opportunities</strong></p><ul><li><p>Secondary One Learning Journey&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Performing Arts Appreciation Program</p></li><li><p>Mother Tongue Fortnight</p></li><li><p>Talent Development Program</p><ul><li><p>The Talent Development Program aims to identify, nurture, and support the unique talents and abilities of students.
