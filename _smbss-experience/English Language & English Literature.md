<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p><p>Our aim is to lead with empathy, make language accessible to all and inspire a deep passion in our students for the English language and English Literature.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In addition to this, we hope to enable students to use the English Language confidently and effectively as leaders and change-makers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our Teaching and Learning Approach</strong></p><p>This approach seeks to capitalise on the power of inductive teaching and reasoning in order to stimulate and extend students’ thinking and understanding. Through this metacognitive tool, students engage in active listening and speaking skills in a rich language environment.</p><p>In the process of developing creative inquirers, students engage with a variety of rich multimodal texts that touch on various key issues. With the exposure to differing perspectives, it is our hope that students become cognizant of the impact on different groups of people, to learn and to develop themselves to become empathetic communicators.</p><p><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p><p>Our signature programmes for students are targeted at the various levels to build students’ proficiency and confidence in using the English Language progressively.</p><ul><li><p><strong>EL FIESTA</strong></p></li></ul><p>EL Fiesta is the English and Literature department’s inaugural platform to combine the learning of English with creative activities where students will have to apply their knowledge of the various English skills and enjoy the process of doing so. Activities ranged from movie screenings to caption and poetry competitions and even a mass spelling bee event in the hall.</p><p>During the poetry competition, students were given the chance to craft their own Haiku poems.</p><p></p><p>These were the winning entries of Imagine Haiku 2023:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Haiku_1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Haiku_2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Haiku_3.jpg"></div></li><li><p><strong>Hosting of Julia Gabriel’s Debating Competition 2023</strong></p></li></ul><p>Selected students had the opportunity to helm the debates, interact with participants and witness firsthand the form and flow of debates</p><ul><li><p><strong>“That’s My View”</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/EL1.png"></div><p>A platform for students to practise public speaking and air their views on contemporary issues, or topics of interest to the school population</p><p><strong>English Literature</strong><br>To cater to the interest of our students, the school offers Literature as a GCE ‘O’ level subject.&nbsp; In the literature classroom, our lower secondary students read and respond to a variety of literary texts, including local texts, from the genres of prose, poetry and drama. Students are guided to explore different perspectives, to gain an appreciation for the literary world, and to deepen their understanding of the world at large.</p><p><br></p>
