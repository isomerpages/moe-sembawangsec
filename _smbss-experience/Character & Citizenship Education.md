<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) @ SMB</strong></p><p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), comprising of National Education (NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. In Sembawang Secondary School, our CCE vision is <strong>civic-minded change-makers with a strong moral compass</strong>. This is in alignment to the national CCE goal, which is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to be good future-ready individuals and useful citizens.</p><p><strong>CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame</strong></p><p>CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way. The CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame takes reference from the existing Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes and aims to enhance clarity on how the core values are linked to the social-emotional competencies, and how they are internalised and lived out by our students.</p><p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the <strong>three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices</strong>, and comprises the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.</p><p>The Curriculum Content Areas include</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>National Education (NE),</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Sexuality Education (SEd),</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Mental Health (MH),</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG),</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Cyber Wellness (CW) and</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Family Education (FE).</strong></p></li></ul><p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, Key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject lessons, and learning opportunities beyond school. For the enactment of CCE to have sustainable impact on our students, a caring and enabling school environment is needed to support their dispositional development.</p><p><strong>Key CCE Programmes:</strong></p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Cyberwellness(CW)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Vaues in Action (VIA)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Citizenship Education (CE)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Eco-Stewardship (ES)</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>1.
