Our teachers conscientiously practice the 3 phases of learning in the classroom – Readiness to Learn, Engagement in Learning and Mastery in Learning.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MA2.png"></div><p>We provide opportunities for students to<br>• enhance conceptual understanding through use of various mathematical tools including ICT tools;<br>• apply concepts and skills learnt in real-world context;<br>• communicate their reasoning and connections through various mathematical tasks and activities;<br>• build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MA3.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MA4.png"></div><p>Students with potential in Mathematics are exposed to higher forms of Mathematical training beyond the curriculum. They are provided with opportunities to further stretch their abilities in National-Level Competitions such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO) and International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS).</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MMA1.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MMA2.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MMA3.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MMA4.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/MMA5.jpeg"></div><h3>Principles of Accounts</h3><p>Principles of Accounts (POA) is designed to teach age-appropriate and relevant accounting knowledge, skills and values. In addition, students will understand how businesses use accounting and non-accounting information to make decisions. Through the subject, they will acquire transferrable skills that they can apply in their daily lives.</p><p>The POA syllabus aims to develop in students the knowledge and skills to prepare, communicate and use both accounting information and non-accounting information related to the business to make decisions.</p><p>The POA unit includes a series of activities to stimulate students’ interest and inquisitiveness towards the subject.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/POA1.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/POA2.png"></div><h3>Computer Application (CPA)</h3><p>The Computer Applications (CPA) curriculum spans over four years, from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4. It is a compulsory subject for all Normal Technical (NT) students and students will sit for the N(T)-Level National Examination at the end of Secondary 4.</p><p>The Computer Applications (CPA) syllabus aims to prepare students to be technologically adept citizens, and to function and contribute effectively in an increasingly technologically-driven world. The syllabus emphasizes on fundamental knowledge and skills, and includes the appreciation and use of several software application packages for word processing, computer drawing and image editing, multimedia presentations and documents, spreadsheet calculations and charts, game design, programming; as well as, applications on the Internet. This will better prepare students for further studies in programming and media-related courses; as well as for the work place and future learning.</p><p>All students will be exposed to internet technologies and tools. Hands-on activities continue to be the main feature of this skill-based subject. Tasks that require an integrated use of office software applications and problem sets that step the learner through the learning process will feature prominently in the course of learning.</p><p>Students will be given opportunities to be exposed to animation and game development projects that will be part of the curriculum in Secondary 2 and Secondary 3, respectively.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CPA1.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CPA2.png"></div><p>Bronze awards recipients of the Animation and Game-Making Competition 2020</p><h5>Department Teachers</h5><p><strong>Head of Department :</strong>&nbsp;Ms Wang Cuiyin</p><p>Subject Head: Ms Isabelle Khoo</p><p>Senior Teacher: Mr Long Chee Yong</p><p><strong>Teachers</strong></p><p><em>Mathematics Unit</em></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Ms Wang Cuiyin (Head of Department Mathematics)</p></li><li><p>Mr Muzaffar Bin Johari (School Staff Developer)</p></li><li><p>Ms Isabelle Khoo (Subject Head, Mathematics)</p></li><li><p>Mr Long Chee Yong (Senior Teacher)</p></li><li><p>Mr Chang Lok</p></li><li><p>Mdm Chen Siew Sze Jessica</p></li><li><p>Ms Chong Nyet Ting</p></li><li><p>Mdm Guan Qiu Hua</p></li><li><p>Mr Kalvindar Singh</p></li><li><p>Ms Kho Puay Hwee Jenny</p></li><li><p>Ms Kor Jia Her</p></li><li><p>Ms Lim Qian Shi Adeline</p></li><li><p>Ms Siew Yan Yee</p></li><li><p>Mdm Suhartini Masod</p></li><li><p>Ms Tan Qian Ying</p></li><li><p>Ms Yeo Moei Leng</p><p></p></li></ul><p><em>POA Unit</em></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Mr Goh Jiang Wee Alan (Head of Department Information &amp; Technology)</p></li><li><p>Ms Kho Puay Hwee Jenny</p><p></p></li></ul><p><em>CPA Unit</em></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Ms Isabelle Khoo (Subject Head, Mathematics)</p></li><li><p>Ms Chong Nyet Ting</p></li><li><p>Mdm Guan Qiu Hua</p></li></ul><p></p>
