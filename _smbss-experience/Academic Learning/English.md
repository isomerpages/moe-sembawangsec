## English

#### Aim/Belief/Philosophy of the department 

For students to use the English Language confidently and effectively as leaders and change-makers.

**Teaching and learning approach**

**Inquiry through Dialogue**&nbsp;is a key approach in the teaching of English Language. This approach seeks to capitalize on the power of classroom talk to stimulate and extend students’ thinking and understanding. With talk as a metacognitive tool, students engage in active listening and speaking skills in a rich language environment.

In the process of developing creative inquirers, students engage with a variety of rich multimodal texts that touch on various key issues. With the exposure to differing perspectives, students become cognizant of the impact on different groups of people, to learn and to develop themselves to become empathetic communicators.


**Key Programmes**

Our signature programmes for students are targeted at the various levels to build students’ proficiency and confidence in using the English Language progressively.

**English Literature**  
To cater to the interest of our students, the school offers Literature as a GCE ‘O’ level subject. &nbsp;In the literature classroom, our lower secondary students read and respond to a variety of literary texts, including local texts, from the genres of prose, poetry and drama. Students are guided to explore different perspectives, to gain an appreciation for the literary word, and to deepen their understanding of the world at large.
