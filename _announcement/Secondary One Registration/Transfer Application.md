## Transfer Application


**Transfer In**

Students who have just received their secondary school posting in 2022 may use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0Zla3eeEM8a6AyZJb4NJFDk1v1JrP9rS2ke7wXRNv59spmA/viewform) to appeal for transfer to Sembawang Secondary School. Their PSLE score should meet the school’s cut-off point of the posting year. Transfer will be subject to available vacancies and the school’s admission criteria.

The deadline for appeal is on **28 December 2022**. The result of the appeal will be released after **31 December 2022** following the outcome of the Mass Appeal Exercise conducted by the Ministry of Education.

**Transfer Out**

Students who intent to transfer out to another school are required to submit the completed and endorsed form **“Annex G”** to our school’s General Office to effect the transfer. The form must be obtained from the school accepting the student for transfer and is required to be endorsed by the School Leaders of that school.

**Note: All parents must register their child/ward, even if they wish to transfer their child/ward out for non-medical reasons. Students seeking transfers should continue to attend their posted secondary school until the transfer is approved. Transfers are subjected to vacancies at the requested transfer school.**
