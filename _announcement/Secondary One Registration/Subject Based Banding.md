## Subject-Based Banding (SBB) \[For Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) Courses\]


**WHAT IS SUBJECT-BASED BANDING (SECONDARY)?** 

Subject-Based Banding (Secondary) \[SBB (Sec)\] is one of many pathways for students to nurture their aptitudes and enhance their access to opportunities throughout their educational journey. SBB (Sec) allows your child to take specific subjects at more demanding level starting from Secondary 1 if he/she is found suitable to do so. If he/she is posted to the N(A) or N(T) course, he/she may be able to take some subjects at Express or N(A) level to allow him/her to stretch himself/herself and acquire deeper competencies in his/her area(s) of strengths.

**HOW DOES SUBJECT-BASED BANDING (SECONDARY) WORK?** 

Students posted to the N(A) and N(T) course are eligible to take some subjects (English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages) at a more demanding level starting from Secondary 1, if they have performed well in these subjects at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE):

*   Students posted to the N(A) or N(T) course who scored AL 5 or better for a PSLE Standard subject can take the subject at the Express level; and
*   Students posted to the N(T) course who scored at least AL 6 for a PSLE Standard subject or A in a PSLE Foundation subject can take it at N(A) level.

Beyond the start of Secondary 1, other N(A) and N(T) students who do well in school-based examinations may be considered to take more demanding level subjects if found suitable to do so by the school.

**If your child is eligible to take subjects at a more demanding level, you will receive the offer letter via your child’s SMBSS email. Please indicate whether your child wishes to ACCEPT or REJECT the offer by 28 December 2021.**

**Please purchase the correct books required for the higher level subjects if your child decides to take up the SBB offer.**
