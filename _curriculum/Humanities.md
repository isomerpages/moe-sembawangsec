<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/HumanitiesFeature.jpeg"></div><h2>Humanities</h2><p><strong>Department’s Philosophy:</strong></p><p>We believe in cultivating an inquiring spirit and developing balanced perspectives of world issues through the humanities.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Department’s Vision:</strong><br>We aim to develop informed, concerned, and active citizens with critical and conceptual lenses through the humanities.</p><p><strong>Key Approaches:</strong></p><p>Humanities subjects (Geography, History and Social Studies) are new to secondary school students. As such, we believe in engaging our students using experiential and authentic learning of Humanities, making use of their day-to-day experiences to build interests and find relevance in learning humanities. Students’ thinking skills are also progressively developed from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4/5.</p><p>We adopt an inquiry-based learning approach in our teaching of the Humanities. In general, it consists of four main areas:</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/H1.png"></div><p>Furthermore, as part of the department’s effort to cultivate the joy of learning and enhance students’ collaboration skills, our students are also provided platforms to take part in&nbsp;competitions such as the Geography and History Challenge.</p><p><strong>Key Programme:</strong></p><p>In the study of Humanities, our students are actively engaged in inquiry. This is best through Geographical &amp; Historical Investigations (GI and HI respectively). Through these experiences, the department hopes to help our students make meaning of what they have learned and nurture their love for the Humanities.</p><p><strong>Lower Secondary Geographical Investigation</strong></p><p>In Secondary 1, students collected evidence to answer the inquiry question, ‘Why is MacRitchie Reservoir important to us?’ To inculcate self-directed learning, students need to do prior research on the location before making use of their sense of sight, touch and smell to find out the usefulness of MacRitchie Reservoir. These activities spark students’ curiosity to learn more about the water quality in Singapore and why we need to conserve the environment.</p><p>In Secondary 2, students were tasked to find out what makes their neighbourhood special. They worked collaboratively to collect data (interview and questionnaire), analyse the data, justify reasons for it, and suggest solutions to improve the neighbourhood.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/H2.jpeg"></div><p><strong>Lower Secondary Historical Investigation</strong></p><p>Historical Investigation is a core component of our students’ learning experience. By utilising a multitude of skills, such as making inferences from sources and collaborating through the use of ICT tools, students apply the skills they learnt during lessons to form critical conclusions on a variety of issues.</p><p>Our Secondary 1 students do this through our Exploration at the Singapore River program. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we adapted this program into a virtual reality learning journey catered to our students’ learning needs. Our Secondary 2 students also have access to a similar virtual learning journey to the Japanese Cemetery Park as part of their historical investigation.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/H3.jpeg"></div><p><strong>Experiential Learning and Authentic Learning</strong></p><p>In order to make learning come alive for Humanities students, students are exposed to experiential learning. In Geography, students also get their hands dirty by creating landforms models and explaining it to their peers to demonstrate their understanding of the content learnt. For History, students were given hands-on opportunities to work on exaction sites at Fort Canning. Through the experience, our students were actively engaged in authentic learning by experiencing the actual process of discovering history. After experiential and authentic leaning experience, students are encouraged to reflect on their learning to ensure that learning continues to take place beyond the textbook.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/H4.jpeg"></div><p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong></p><p>The Humanities Department piloted the use of virtual reality (VR) videos as part of our students’ learning experience in 2018. We have developed a variety of VR videos allowing stronger engagement of students’ interests. For instance, students ‘go’ to the volcanoes through virtual reality (VR) to find out more about the landscape around</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/H5.jpeg"></div><p>volcanoes and the impact of living near volcanoes. Our library of VR resources include virtual trips to the Singapore River, Amazon Rainforest, the Japanese Cemetery Park and the Berlin Wall, and continues to expand each year</p><p><strong>Collaboration with the English Department</strong></p><p>In 2020, the department embarked on a joint reading programme called GRIT (Growing Readers, Inspiring Thinkers). Through this programme, students are provided with opportunities to explore contemporary issues and engage in discussions with their peers. Through this, students are made aware that there are multiple perspectives on an issue and learn how to engage themselves when dealing with such differences.</p><h3>Team Humanities:</h3><p><strong>Head of Department :</strong>&nbsp;Ms Jasvinder Kaur</p><p><strong>Senior Teacher/History&nbsp;:</strong>&nbsp;Mr Chua Si Yuan</p><p><strong>Senior Teacher/Geography :</strong>&nbsp;Mdm Julistiara Sujae</p><p><strong>Teachers</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Ms Jasvinder Kaur (SS)</p></li><li><p>Mdm Julistiara Sujae (GE/SS)</p></li><li><p>Mr Chua Si Yuan (HE/SS)</p></li><li><p>Ms Munirah Bte Saini (GE)</p></li><li><p>Mr Mohamad Zulqarnain (SS)</p></li><li><p>Mr Zeng Hengguang (PE/GE)</p></li><li><p>Ms Kor Jia Her (SS/Maths)</p></li><li><p>Ms Tan Qian Ying (SS/Maths)</p></li><li><p>Mr Joe Wieky (EL/SS)</p></li></ul><p></p>
