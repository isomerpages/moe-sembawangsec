Applied Learning Programme
==========================

**What is the ALP at Sembawang Secondary School?**

Our school-based ALP is an innovative curriculum that is aligned with SkillsFuture. It is piloted in the Humanities and leverages 21st Century Competencies (21CC) with focus on Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT) through Media Literacy.

**Why the need for the ALP at Sembawang Secondary School?**

The ALP curriculum at Sembawang Secondary School aims to develop students as critical consumers and producers of media and knowledge in various disciplines through:

*   critical analysis and evaluation of media sources of information in the Humanities;
*   connections of the knowledge in the Humanities with Art and English Language;
*   creation of media products;
*   collaboration through productivity tools; and
*   application of learning to real-world contexts.

**What kind of media literacy skills do our students learn as part of the ALP?**

_Firstly_, our students will learn **media reception skills**. This means they will be equipped with thinking skills to critically interpret, analyse, question, and evaluate information from different media sources (e.g. print, online, visual, oral). Our aim is for students to be better able to question the information they see in the media and to discern any hidden messages or purposes.[![schoolbag](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/schoolbag.jpg)](https://www.schoolbag.sg/story/ready-for-the-digital-world)

_Secondly_, students will be equipped **media creation skills**. Our students will be trained in using appropriate media tools to convey a message, with the aim of persuading a target audience (e.g., creating posters, infographics, videos, graphs etc).

_Lastly_, we will also enhance our students’ competencies in **digital productivity**. Students will be guided in using appropriate digital media tools (e.g., google docs, popplet) to enhance their personal productivity and collaborate effectively with others. These are skills they will find useful when they enter the digital age workplace.

Sembawang Secondary School is committed to prepare our students to thrive in the modern technology-rich environment. As part of this commitment, we are striving to ensure that each student has the opportunity to expand their critical-thinking skills and exercise their innovative spirit.

Science, Technology and Mathematics (STeM) is an interdisciplinary approach that integrates these disciplines into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world applications. STeM programme aims to nurture future-ready and innovative digital learners. This 3-year developmental programme is designed to develop Secondary one to three students’ computation thinking and basic programming knowledge, and engage students in authentic and joyful learning experiences.

Examples of our existing learning modules:

![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/it5.jpg)

Upon completing this programme, students would be equipped with skills necessary to thrive in this technology-rich environment and solve problems applying programming knowledge and disciplinary thinking (i.e. scientific/mathematical) and computational thinking. In addition, this programme aims to excite and inspire students to pursue post-secondary ICT-related learning opportunities.

In 2021, the learning modules would include drone programming, robotics, mobile games programming and Internet of Things (IOT).

Learning for Life Programme

SMB Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme

VIA programme aims to promote active citizenry among our youth and bring about a greater sense of engagement and ownership. Teachers facilitate students’ discussion of community issues and ideas for making a difference. Curriculum time will be set aside for students to reflect on what they have learnt at various stages of their projects. In that way, students continue to apply what they have learnt, and be active contributors and concerned citizens. Students are encouraged to initiate VIA activities based on their assessment of the needs of their community.

The VIA Programme will have age-appropriate activities that develop the relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes to put values into action. The _Complexity of Community Problem_ differs for the different levels (Sec 1 to Sec 5).

*   **At Sec 1,** students are the Change Makers @Sembawang Sec, focusing on the theme of recycling and saving the Environment.
*   **At Sec 2,** students are the Change Makers in the Community, advocating recycling messages to the community.
*   **At Sec 3,** students are the Change Makers who take actions to contribute to the Community through self-initiated VIA activities.
*   **At Sec 4/5,** students are the Change Advocates of national and global issues to inspire and influence others to make a difference to something important that they care.

PEARL
=====

**Programme to Empower Active and Responsible Learning (PEARL)**

![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/it2.jpg)

In alignment with the outcome goal of the MOE MasterPlan for ICT in Education – Quality learning in the hands of every learner empowered with technology, PEARL is the school’s very own 1-1 computing access initiative launched in 2017. PEARL aims to promote Active Learning in class through the use of ICT so that our students become better thinkers and more reflective learners.

![](https://sembawangsec.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/it3.jpg)

Teachers, as designers of active learning experiences, are empowered to create an ICT-enriched classroom that is thinking, collaborative and connected. Hence, students would have opportunities to harness the use of technology for collaboration, brainstorming of ideas (making their thinking visible), co-construction of knowledge and even authentic problem-solving in the learning process.

In 2021, PEARL to include MOE’s Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) supporting students on ownership of 1:1 computing devices for learning. 

**Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)**

**PDLP Outcomes @ Sembawang Secondary**

Through PDLP, we aspire to develop our learners as leaders and change-makers:

(i) active, self-directed and collaborative learners who will deepen their disciplinary thinking/skills through active and blended learning experiences, develop their 21CC as well as manage their own learning;

(ii) responsible and competent digital learners who will develop their repertoire of digital literacies for application in their learning process, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

**Supporting your child on safe and effective use of PLD**

The school has put in place some measures and policies to enable a safe and conducive learning environment. The role of parents/guardians is critical in supporting your child/ward in this journey.
