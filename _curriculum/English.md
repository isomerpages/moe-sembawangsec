#### Mission of English Language Department

Students to use the English Language confidently and effectively as leaders and change-makers.

**Approach to English Language Teaching**

**Inquiry through Dialogue** is a key approach in the teaching of English Language. This approach seeks to capitalize on the power of classroom talk to stimulate and extend students’ thinking and understanding. With talk as a metacognitive tool, students engage in active listening and speaking skills in a rich language environment.

In the process of developing creative inquirers, students engage with a variety of rich multimodal texts that touch on various key issues. With the exposure to differing perspectives, students become cognizant of the impact on different groups of people, to learn and to develop themselves to become empathetic communicators.

**G.R.I.T (Growing Readers, Inspiring Thinkers) Programme**

Our firm conviction is that our students are leaders and change-makers in their own right. As such, it is important for our students to be exposed to authentic contexts. To bring the world into the classroom, we started G.R.I.T. (Growing Readers, Inspiring Thinkers) which is a joint collaboration between the English and Humanities Department to introduce contemporary issues and facilitate discussions. Students gain an in-depth understanding as they unpack the issues presented by using annotation skills and form perspectives through engaged discussions. There is a coverage of topics ranging from local to international issues allowing students to hone their critical thinking skills as they listen to various perspectives shared by their peers and decide on their own stand as informed citizens.

**Signature Programmes for Students**

Our signature programmes for students are targeted at the various levels to build students’ proficiency and confidence in using the English Language progressively.

**English Literature**  
To cater to the interest of our students, the school offers Literature as a GCE ‘O’ level subject.  In the literature classroom, our lower secondary students read and respond to a variety of literary texts, including local texts, from the genres of prose, poetry and drama. Students are guided to explore different perspectives, to gain an appreciation for the literary word, and to deepen their understanding of the world at large.
