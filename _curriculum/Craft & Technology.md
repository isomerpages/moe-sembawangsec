#### HOW


**Teaching and Learning Practice**

As we believe that every child can learn, we want to equip our students the knowledge and skills, and imbue values and attitude to Creative Leader and Change Maker. We want our students to be self-directed, to be able to learn independently and most importantly find joy in learning.

We use Gradual Release of Responsibilities Instructional framework to plan our lessons so that our students are equipped with skills to collaborate and to learn independently. Teachers can model thinking process. Our teachers and students are clear of their learning objectives and the success criteria.

To prepare our students for an increasingly complex, interconnected and tech-driven world. We design our curriculum so that our students develop competencies to acquire and apply knowledge (K), skills (S), to build attitudes(A) and values(V) to meet the complex demands. Our curriculum provide opportunities for our students to apply KSAV in different context and scenarios.
