**WHY**
-------

Craft and Technology Department aims to nurture our students to be creative and innovative thinkers who lead change with empathy. Our students learn through reflecting on doing (Experiential Learning) and we seek to develop them into explorative, independent and versatile learners who are adaptable and undaunted by changes.

**HOW**
-------

**Teaching and Learning Practice**

As we believe that every child can learn, we want to equip our students the knowledge and skills, and imbue values and attitude to Creative Leader and Change Maker. We want our students to be self-directed, to be able to learn independently and most importantly find joy in learning.

We use Gradual Release of Responsibilities Instructional framework to plan our lessons so that our students are equipped with skills to collaborate and to learn independently. Teachers can model thinking process. Our teachers and students are clear of their learning objectives and the success criteria.

We ensure that our students are clear of the success criteria for every lesson based on the learning objectives. Our students can monitor their own learning and can experience success knowing that they have learned.

**WHAT**
--------

To prepare our students for an increasingly complex, interconnected and tech-driven world. We design our curriculum so that our students develop competencies to acquire and apply knowledge (K), skills (S), to build attitudes(A) and values(V) to meet the complex demands. Our curriculum provide opportunities for our students to apply KSAV in different context and scenarios.
