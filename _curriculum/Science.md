## Science


**1. Aim/Belief/Philosophy of the department**
<br>The Science Educators aim to:<br>
a) Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they can make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives; and<br>
b) Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.


**2. Teaching and learning approach**  

a) Science learning@SMBSS should be coherent and meaningful, organized around ideas central to Science (Core Ideas)
    
b)  This is supported by hands-on, authentic learning to experience how intricately related the cognitive, epistemic, and social aspects of Science are (Practices)
    
c)  Science learning@SMBSS also equips students with the ability to share their ethical stand (Values, Ethics and Attitudes) as they participate in discussions about socio-scientific issues that involve ethical dilemmas
  

**3. Key Programmes**

a) To inspire all SMBSS Science students, the Science Fortnight aims to provide broad based exposure in the areas of:<br>
* appreciating Science in everyday life.<br>
* Behaving like a scientist.<br>
* Celebrating successes of fellow SMBSS students.

Students participating in science demonstrations and learning journeys as part of the Science Fortnight programme. <br><br>
b) Inspired SMBSS students are then invited to build on their interest through:<br>
* Deeper understanding of the inquiry process. <br>
* Engagement by Science researchers in their endeavours in their respective fields. <br> 
* Gaining deeper understanding of their own skills and dispositions towards Science.

Students participating in subject specific learning journeys to gain deeper understanding of the scientific discipline. <br><br>
c) Passionate SMBSS students will then:<br>
* Go through the process of innovation, where top-tier competitions allow them to exhibit and
* hone their skills and dispositions, culminating in sharing of their Ideas, processes, and findings.

Studentsâ€™ achievements
    

Science Learning@SMBSS is committed to provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and achieve excellence in the sciences. Beyond the curriculum, our caring team of science educators are also dedicated mentors to our students taking part in various multi-level competitions.

<br>

**a) Elementz**
    

The annual Elementz fair and conference provide a platform for our students to apply and sharpen their skills in the conduct of Science Inquiry. They conduct investigations to prove their hypothesis and defend their projects against professionals in the field. To any student who is interested in Science, this competition is an invaluable opportunity to learn what it truly means to be a Scientist.
