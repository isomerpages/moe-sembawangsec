**Opportunities and Achievements**

In Sembawang Secondary School, our science department is committed to provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and achieve excellence in the sciences. Beyond the curriculum, our caring team of science teachers are also dedicated mentors to our students taking part in various multi-level competitions.

**Elementz**

The annual Elementz fair and conference provide a platform for our students to apply and sharpen their skills in the conduct of Science. They conduct experiments to prove their hypothesis and defend their projects against professionals in the field. To any student who is interested in Science, this competition is an invaluable opportunity to learn what it truly means to be a Scientist.

**IgnITE Skills Challenge**

The IgnITE Skills Challenge was designed to introduce students to technical skills. In the Logistics Challenge, students learnt about emerging technologies in the logistics industry and apply their drone piloting knowledge to perform different logistics operations through gamification. They will also design and present a future warehouse concept.

**ICAS**

The ICAS (International Competitions and Assessments for Schools) provides an opportunity for students to further stretch their abilities, think beyond the classroom, identify their strengths and weaknesses to improve their individual study skills and identify talent for further enrichment. Students are tested on a plethora of skill sets such as interpreting data, scientific investigation, reasoning and problem solving. Students are also exposed to interdisciplinary content stretching from Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.
