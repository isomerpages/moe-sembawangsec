Strive, serve and soar<br>
As we march on with highest endeavour<br>
Striding forward heads held high<br>
Sembawang forever

A pillar of strength in the north<br>
Great seat of knowledge and learning<br>
We give our very best with energy and zest<br>
Staunch hearts within each are burning<br>
To see our School strong and recognised<br>
As the Nation's pride and joy<br>
It's the fervent affirmation in each of us<br>
Every teacher, girl or boy

Strive, serve and soar<br>
As we march on with highest endeavour<br>
Striding forward heads held high<br>
Sembawang forever

A blazing torch held aloft<br>
Warm flame of friendship and caring<br>
Lights every joyful day, in duties, work and play<br>
High hopes with each we are sharing<br>
To comfort those who are suffering<br>
As we spread abroad life's love<br>
With such strength and dedication in all of us<br>
Alma mater soars above

Strive, serve and soar<br>
As we march on with highest endeavour<br>
Striding forward heads held high<br>
Sembawang forever<br>
Sembawang
