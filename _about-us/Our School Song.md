Strive, serve and soar  
As we march on with highest endeavour  
Striding forward heads held high  
Sembawang forever

A pillar of strength in the north  
Great seat of knowledge and learning  
We give our very best with energy and zest  
Staunch hearts within each are burning

To see our School strong and recognised  
As the Nation’s pride and joy  
It’s the fervent affirmation in each of us  
Every teacher, girl and boy

Strive, serve and soar  
As we march on with highest endeavour  
Striding forward heads held high  
Sembawang forever

A blazing torch held aloft  
Warm flame of friendship and caring  
Lights every joyful day, in duties, work and play  
High hopes with each we are sharing

To comfort those who are suffering  
As we spread abroad life’s love  
With such strength and dedication in all of us  
Alma mater soars above

Strive, serve and soar  
As we march on with highest endeavour  
Striding forward heads held high  
Sembawang forever  
Sembawang
