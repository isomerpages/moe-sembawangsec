## Principal's Message
     
Our students are the stewards of tomorrow. The future is in their hands. With the changing educational and global landscape, we dedicated time for conversations among staff to envision the holistic education that we desire for our students.<br>  
Our School Mission, ***Nurturing Reflective Learners and Contributing Citizens***, defines our purpose as educators. We want our students to be Leaders of Good Character and Active Contributors - to be caring, confident and resilient leaders who contribute to the community, to be equipped with media and digital literacies, skills and dispositions to excel in learning, and to discover their strengths and pursue their interests and aspirations.<br>

Our students are privileged to have caring and committed teachers, allied educators and school administration team. I am deeply appreciative of my colleagues in Sembawang Secondary who often go the extra mile for our students. Much thought is put into conceptualizing and planning the learning experiences for our students, and in guiding them in reflecting on their learning. <br>

I thank our students’ parents who continue to partner us in nurturing them. We appreciate that our parents keep in touch with us on matters pertaining to their children. Our parents also make time for their children for events such as parents’ engagement sessions and activities such as parenting talks and parent-child bonding sessions. We look forward to your continued partnership. <br>

My appreciation also goes to our School Advisory Committee, alumni and community partners for their support and contributions. I look forward to your continued support in providing a quality holistic education for our children. 
To all students of Sembawang Secondary, may you be guided and shaped by our school values - ***Integrity, Resilience, Responsibility, Respect, Empathy, Gratitude*** – to be Leaders and Change-makers. Continue to seize the learning opportunities that come your way. Rise above challenges and bring out the best that is in you. <br>

Strive, Serve and Soar!
