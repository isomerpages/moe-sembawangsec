<h2>Principal's Message</h2>
<p>As we celebrate Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday in 2025, we are grateful
for the vision and hard work of those who paved the way for us. Along the
way, we have faced obstacles, yet our unity, resilience and determination
have allowed us to emerge stronger each time.
<br>
</p>
<p>As stewards of tomorrow, our students have vital role in shaping Singapore’s
future. Their shared values, actions and dreams will steer our nation through
future challenges. Our School Mission, <strong><em>Nurturing Reflective Learners and Contributing Citizens</em></strong>,
defines our purpose as educators in nurturing our students as <strong><em>Leaders and Change-makers</em></strong>.
We want our students to be Leaders of Good Character and Active Contributors
- to be caring, confident and resilient leaders who contribute to the community,
to be equipped with media and digital literacies, skills and dispositions
to excel in learning, and to discover their strengths and pursue their
interests and aspirations.
<br>
</p>
<p>Our students are privileged to have caring and committed teachers, allied
educators and school administration team in their journey. I am deeply
appreciative of my colleagues in Sembawang Secondary who often go the extra
mile for our students. They put much thought into conceptualizing, planning
and executing the learning experiences for our students, and in guiding
them in reflecting on their learning.
<br>
</p>
<p>I thank our students’ parents who continue to partner us in nurturing
them. We appreciate that our parents keep in touch with us on matters pertaining
to their children and for making time for their children in our various
engagement sessions. We look forward to your continued partnership.
<br>
</p>
<p>My appreciation also goes to our School Advisory Committee, alumni and
community partners for their support and contributions in providing a quality
holistic education for our children.
<br>
</p>
<p>To all students of Sembawang Secondary, hold close to your hearts our
school values - <strong><em>Resilience, Responsibility, Respect, Empathy, Integrity, Gratitude</em></strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong>Embrace
learning opportunities that come your way, rise above challenges and bring
out the best that is in you.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Strive, Serve and Soar!</strong>
