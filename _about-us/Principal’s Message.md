## Principal's Message
     
It is my privilege to serve alongside a team of caring and committed colleagues as I embark on my journey as the 5th Principal of Sembawang Secondary School. The culture of care and sense of mission are evident from my first visit to the school, and I have my predecessors, most recently, Mr Jaswant Singh, to thank for this.   

Our students are our future, and we have the duty to prepare them for a future that is constantly changing, so that they see possibilities amidst the complexities and opportunities amidst the challenges. We want our students to be **_Leaders and Change Makers_**, who actively enrich the lives of others now and in the future.  

In an environment where change is the only constant, being anchored on sound values is critical and we devote conscious efforts to instill our school values - **_Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Innovative Spirit, Resilience, Empathy_** - in our students.  Meaningful educational experiences in the academic curriculum and co-curriculum are designed and provided for our students for all-round development. Through a holistic education, we **_nurture our learners to lead purposeful lives by guiding them to be morally upright, civic-minded, resilient, and future-ready_**.

As my team and I build on the good work of our predecessors, we look forward to the continued partnership with our students’ parents as we work together to nurture our children. I am also grateful to our School Advisory Committee, alumni, and community partners for their support as we continue to provide our children with a quality holistic education.

I encourage all students of Sembawang Secondary School to seize the learning opportunities given and to give your best in all that you attempt. The power of belief - belief in self and belief in others - motivates us towards the goals we set, to achieve what others may see as impossible.

To quote Mahatma Gandhi:

_Men often become what they believe themselves to be. If I believe I cannot do something, it makes me incapable of doing it. But when I believe I can, then I acquire the ability to do it, even if I didn’t have it in the beginning._

**_Strive, Serve and Soar_**
